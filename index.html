<h1>Aquila Market</h1>

<p>This is a market where buyers and sellers can trade arbitrary goods
or services for Bitcoin. The market is controlled by a closed group
of owners, and its admins are elected by majority vote. Ownership is
tracked in the blockchain, and shares can be transferred among mutually
untrusting owners, optionally in exchange for Bitcoin in an atomic
operation. The market is designed to protect its users' privacy,
and its protocol is Tor-friendly.</p>

<p>The network consists of servers run by the owners and a thin client
run by all users. The thin client connects to multiple servers, and
is designed to provide reasonably good security properties while keeping
minimum local state, using SPV-style verification of the market's
ownership and control.</p>

<p>The client is available now. The server will be released soon. In our
security model, any bug that can cause disclosure of secret information
or loss of funds is by definition a client bug. The client below uses
testnet Bitcoin, and connects to a couple of servers that I'm running
as Tor hidden services. If you're not running Tor, then the client will
always fail.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="aquila-live-dangerous.html">
            client, for running live from network
        </a>
        <ul><li>
            The client is a JavaScript program, so you can run it without
            installation. By doing this, you are trusting GitHub's servers
            and me every time you run the market. This is an unnecessary
            risk.
        </li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev942/aquila/master/client/build/aquila-standalone-safe.html">
            client, for saving locally
        </a>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You can download the client as a single HTML file with no
                further dependencies, save it locally (e.g., to your desktop),
                and run it from there. This is preferred.
            </li><li>
                Sadly, <b>Tor Browser Bundle seems not to support
                localStorage for file:// URLs</b>. This is a necessary
                feature. I'm investigating, but for now your options
                are either to run live, or to use a normal web browser
                build and point it to Tor by hand.
            </li>
        </ul>

            source code
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>I plan to launch a livenet market soon, with initial ownership
distributed among people who have reported vulnerabilities in the client
or otherwise contributed to the project. See the forums on the market
for details.</p>
